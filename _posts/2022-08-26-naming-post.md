    <details><summary>INTRODUCTION: General conventions for numbering and naming</summary>

    >### This intro section describes general conventions to create object numbers for time-based media works and their assocaited components and/or accessories. 
    >#### It also desceribes how digital preservxdation files and derivatives are named/numbered.  

    <br/>
    The most general formulation for numbering time-based works on one a single media carrier is:

    >**2018.37.2.1a**  
    >*[accessionYear].[collectionNumber].[workNumber].[instantiationNumber][componentElement]*  

    <br/>  
    The most general formulation for numbering time-based media works on multiple carriers:

    >**2018.37.2.1a**  
    >**2018.37.2.1b**  
    >*[accessionYear].[collectionNumber].[workNumber].[instantiationNumber][componentElement]*

    <br/>


    *where:*


    >***Accession Year*** = the year in which the collection is accessioned

    >***Collection Number*** = the order in which the collection was accessioned in that accession year 

    >***Work Number*** = the work (or object) number in the accessioned collection. 
    >> ##### Note that works (or objects) can only share work numbers when they are within the same collection.

    >***Instantiation Number*** = a number for the instantiation of a work (or object)

    >***Component Element*** = starting with letter **a**, give component letters to all carriers of the media essence. Then number all cans, cases, reels and ephemera as components or accessories to their associated component element.

    >> ##### For films to be projected, i.e., 35mm showprint collections, a reel number may be appened to the object number on the physical film head/tail leader and the film can(s) for projection booth clarity: reel number = R1 for reel 1, R2 for reel 2, R3 for reel 3, etc.  
    <br/>

    <details><summary>Series Numbering</summary>

    ```
    Mixed archival collections containing time-based works, such as the Pearl Bowser collection, have a Series Number inserted between the Collection Number and Work Number. This number is used to indicate the type of media carrier.

    >1. motion picure film: all gauges and bases
    >2. video: tape-based video formats, both cassette and open-reel   
    >3. audio: tape-based audio formats, both cassetes and open-reel
    >4. optical discs: all optical disc formats - DVD, CD, Laserdisc, etc.
    >5. digital carriers: all digital carriers - harddrives, thumbdrives, computer disks, etc.
    >>> ###### the content of the digital carrier, e.g. digital photos, digital video, digital audio, software, word processing documents, etc., does not impact the numbering
    >6. photographs: silver based, other analog processes and printed digital images
    >7. paper items: all loose leaf paper items, flyers, posters, etc.
    >8. bound paper items: books and magazines
    >9. objects: furniture, trophies, clothing, all other objects
    ``` 
    </details>

    - - -  

    <br/>

    The character `a` must be used to designate the first physical carrier for the essence or signal (videotape, audiotape or film), and that the subsequent characters be used for any remaining phsyical carriers in the instantiation. Any containers, cans, cases or other ephemera related to the physical carrier will likley be accessory components in TMS.
    >> ##### acessory components in TMS are differentiated from "part of an object" components.  
    <br/> 

    For example, where the work is a feature film in a can on one reel/core with Work Number 2018.37.2, the film itself will have the Instantiation Number `1` with Component Element `a`, e.g. object number `2018.37.2.1a`, while the can holding the film will have the same Instantiation Number and Component Element with the Accessory Suffix `acc1` appened with an underscore, e.g. object number `2018.37.2.1a_acc1` and the reel/core holding the film will have the Suffix Element `acc2`, e.g. object number `2018.37.2.1a_acc2`. Any additional ephemera in the film can, such as lab printing records or other pieces of filmlab paper, will have the Suffix Element `_acc3` and so on.  

    When a accessory is associated with more than one Component Element, that accessory will have both Component Element letters in its object number. For instance, if a film can with the Accessory Suffix acc_1 contains two reels/cores of film with object numbers `2018.37.2.1a` & `2018.37.2.1b`, the object number for the film can will be `2018.37.2.1ab_acc1`. Don't make two object numbers for the can, e.g. creating both `2018.37.2.1a` and `2018.37.2.1b` for the singular can is incorrect. 

    >> ##### when deciding what numerical order to creat the accessories to an object, give number `1` to the accessory carrying the most metadata about the object. For films this is most often the can/case and, as such, the can/case if given Accessory Suffix number `1` while reels/core and other ephemera are given later numbers. Don't skip numbers when assigning Accessory Suffix.

    Given the variety of media objects across the Museum's time-based collections of film, video, audio and digital objects, this process of naming and numbering is difficult to formulate for every possible situation and these guidelines are a living document.

<details><summary>Circumstance C : One reel of 35mm film with three shorter 'works' spliced together and held on the same metal reel, inside one metal canister. All film is silent.</summary>
<br/>

>#### **Circumstance C:**
*One reel of 35mm film with three shorter 'works' spliced together and held on the same metal reel, inside one metal canister. All film is silent.

In this case the archivist assigning numbers and inspecting the film would have two choices. The first choice is to separate the 'works' and assinging each their own unique work numbers. This would entail rehousing each film on a new core, etc. After that the numbering would be similar to Circumstance A.

| Component | Object # |
| --- | --- |
| Film (work 1) | 2013.19.1.1a |
| Film (work 2) | 2013.19.2.1a |
| Film (work 3) | 2013.19.3.1a |
| Metal canister | 2013.19.1-3.1a_acc1 |
| Metal reel | 2013.19.1-3.1a_acc2 |
| DPX Package (work 1) | 2013_19_1_1a.mkv |
| DPX Package (work 2) | 2013_19_2_1b.mkv |
| DPX Package (work 3) | 2013_19_3_1c.mkv |
| digital access file(s) derived from DPX packagee (work 1) | 2013_19_1_1a.mov/.mp4 |
| digital access file(s) derived from DPX packagee (work 2) | 2013_19_2_1a.mov/.mp4 |
| digital access file(s) derived from DPX packagee (work 3) | 2013_19_3_1a.mov/.mp4 |
| | |

The other option would be to splice all the 'works' together with a bit of leader between each and place them on one core and assign one work and instantiation number to the entire reel. This would again result in numbering similar to Circumstance A. 

| Component | Object # |
| --- | --- |
| Film | 2013.19.1.1a |
| Metal canister | 2013.19.1.1a_acc1 |
| Metal reel | 2013.19.1.1a_acc2 |
| DPX Package | 2013_19_1_1a.mkv |
| digital access file(s) derived from DPX packagee | 2013_19_1_1a.mov/.mp4 |
| | |

> #### When making this decision, think about if this is why the films may be spliced together? Was it done by the filmmaker to present a sample reel of work? A previous collector whose arhchival organization is important? Is it simply left this way after arriving from a processing lab? Ask which of these choices makes the archive more accessible and understandable.

<details><summary>Circumstance D : Five smaller rolls of 16mm film on plastic cores, from an assortment of different 'works,' grouped together arbitrarily in the same 35mm metal canister. Some of the rolls are constituent reels of a single 'work'; others, not.</summary>
<br/>

>#### **Circumstance D:**
*Five smaller rolls of 16mm film on plastic cores, from an assortment of different 'works,' grouped together arbitrarily in the same 35mm metal canister. Some of the rolls are constituent reels of a single 'work'; others, not.*

This would be very similar to Circumstance C but there would be stronger reasons for the archivist to separate the rolls that are constituent of a single 'work' into a new Work Number. If there is already a copy of that work in the same collection, then a new Instantiation Number would be created.

The numbering would be similar to Circumstance A.

In a situation where a great number of trims related to a work are grouped together in a container, the appropriate decision is to combine all of the trims into a single reel with leader in-between them and either:
- create a new instantiation and a single component letter
- create a new instantiation and with each trim having it's own component letter  

this choice will be based upon what makes the most sense for the archive and how many trims are on the newly created reel.

<details><summary>Circumstance E : Mixed archival collection containing time-based medaia.</summary>
<br/>

> #### Circumstance E:
*Mixed archival collection containing time-based media.*
<br/>
<br/>
>Mixed archival collections containing time-based media works, such as the Pearl Bowser collection (2012.79), have a Series Number inserted between the Collection Number and Work Number. This number is used to indicate the type of media carrier or object.

>1. motion picure film: all gauges and bases
>2. video: tape-based video formats, both cassette and open-reel   
>3. audio: tape-based audio formats, both cassetes and open-reel
>4. optical discs: all optical disc formats - DVD, CD, Laserdisc, etc.
>5. digital carriers: all digital carriers - harddrives, thumbdrives, computer disks, etc.
>>> ###### the content of the digital carrier, e.g. digital photos, digital video, digital audio, software, word processing documents, etc., does not impact the numbering
>6. photographs: silver based, other analog processes and printed digital images
>7. paper items: all loose leaf paper items, flyers, posters, etc.
>8. bound paper items: books and magazines
>9. objects: furniture, trophies, clothing, all other objects

So, motion picture film objects in this colleciton have a numbering like this:

>2012.79.2.1.1a  
>>*accessionYear(2012).collectionNumber(79).**seriesNumber(1)**.workNumber(1).instantiaionNumber(1)componentElement(a)*

The time-based media series in the Pear Bowser Collection look like:

- 2012.79.1 - Motion Picture Films
    - Over 100 short- and feature-length motion picture films relating to the African American experience. Titles include home movies, television documentaries, musical concert films, early twentieth-century 'race films,' outtake fragments, and other ephemera.
- 2012.79.2 - Analog Videotapes
    - Approximately 246 video recordings, including television appearances by Pearl Bowser, promotional spots, music videos, and a significant number of standard definition telecine transfers of materials originating on film (many of which are held in the collection's film series).
- 2012.79.3 - Analog Audiotapes
    - Approximately 213 audiocassettes containing oral histories recorded by Pearl Bowser, between the years of 1972 and the early 1990s, as a part of her Ford Foundation-funded grant project to document the history of African American filmmaking in the United States.

For the Bowser collection, single moving image work instantiated on a single 16mm reel contained in a metal can would follow Scenario A as such:

*One motion picture film sound film on a metal projection reel contained in a metal canister.*

**For film:**  
>*accessionYear(2012).collectionNumber(79).seriesNumber(1).workNumber(16).instantiationNumber(1)componentElement(a)*  

**For metal canister:**
>*accessionYear(2012).collectionNumber(79).seriesNumber(1).workNumber(16).instantiationNumber(1)componentElement(a)_acc1*

The other option would be to splice all the 'works' together with a bit of leader between each and place them on one core and assign one work and instantiation number to the entire reel. This would again result in numbering similar to Circumstance A. 

| Component | Object # |
| --- | --- |
| Film | 2013.19.1.1a |
| Metal canister | 2013.19.1.1a_acc1 |
| Metal reel | 2013.19.1.1a_acc2 |
| DPX Package | 2013_19_1_1a.mkv |
| digital access file(s) derived from DPX packagee | 2013_19_1_1a.mov/.mp4 |

> #### When making this decision, think about if this is why the films may be spliced together? Was it done by the filmmaker to present a sample reel of work? A previous collector whose arhchival organization is important? Is it simply left this way after arriving from a processing lab? Ask which of these choices makes the archive more accessible and understandable.

<details><summary>Circumstance D : Five smaller rolls of 16mm film on plastic cores, from an assortment of different 'works,' grouped together arbitrarily in the same 35mm metal canister. Some of the rolls are constituent reels of a single 'work'; others, not.</summary>
<br/>

>#### **Circumstance D:**
*Five smaller rolls of 16mm film on plastic cores, from an assortment of different 'works,' grouped together arbitrarily in the same 35mm metal canister. Some of the rolls are constituent reels of a single 'work'; others, not.*

This would be very similar to Circumstance C but there would be stronger reasons for the archivist to separate the rolls that are constituent of a single 'work' into a new Work Number. If there is already a copy of that work in the same collection, then a new Instantiation Number would be created.

The numbering would be similar to Circumstance A.

In a situation where a great number of trims related to a work are grouped together in a container, the appropriate decision is to combine all of the trims into a single reel with leader in-between them and either:
- create a new instantiation and a single component letter
- create a new instantiation and with each trim having it's own component letter  

this choice will be based upon what makes the most sense for the archive and how many trims are on the newly created reel.

<details><summary>Circumstance E : Mixed archival collection containing time-based medaia.</summary>
<br/>

> #### Circumstance E:
*Mixed archival collection containing time-based media.*
<br/>
<br/>
>Mixed archival collections containing time-based media works, such as the Pearl Bowser collection (2012.79), have a Series Number inserted between the Collection Number and Work Number. This number is used to indicate the type of media carrier or object.

>1. motion picure film: all gauges and bases
>2. video: tape-based video formats, both cassette and open-reel   
>3. audio: tape-based audio formats, both cassetes and open-reel
>4. optical discs: all optical disc formats - DVD, CD, Laserdisc, etc.
>5. digital carriers: all digital carriers - harddrives, thumbdrives, computer disks, etc.
>>> ###### the content of the digital carrier, e.g. digital photos, digital video, digital audio, software, word processing documents, etc., does not impact the numbering
>6. photographs: silver based, other analog processes and printed digital images
>7. paper items: all loose leaf paper items, flyers, posters, etc.
>8. bound paper items: books and magazines
>9. objects: furniture, trophies, clothing, all other objects

So, motion picture film objects in this colleciton have a numbering like this:

>2012.79.2.1.1a  
>>*accessionYear(2012).collectionNumber(79).**seriesNumber(1)**.workNumber(1).instantiaionNumber(1)componentElement(a)*

The time-based media series in the Pear Bowser Collection look like:

- 2012.79.1 - Motion Picture Films
    - Over 100 short- and feature-length motion picture films relating to the African American experience. Titles include home movies, television documentaries, musical concert films, early twentieth-century 'race films,' outtake fragments, and other ephemera.
- 2012.79.2 - Analog Videotapes
    - Approximately 246 video recordings, including television appearances by Pearl Bowser, promotional spots, music videos, and a significant number of standard definition telecine transfers of materials originating on film (many of which are held in the collection's film series).
- 2012.79.3 - Analog Audiotapes
    - Approximately 213 audiocassettes containing oral histories recorded by Pearl Bowser, between the years of 1972 and the early 1990s, as a part of her Ford Foundation-funded grant project to document the history of African American filmmaking in the United States.

For the Bowser collection, single moving image work instantiated on a single 16mm reel contained in a metal can would follow Scenario A as such:

*One motion picture film sound film on a metal projection reel contained in a metal canister.*

**For film:**  
>*accessionYear(2012).collectionNumber(79).seriesNumber(1).workNumber(16).instantiationNumber(1)componentElement(a)*  

**For metal canister:**
>*accessionYear(2012).collectionNumber(79).seriesNumber(1).workNumber(16).instantiationNumber(1)componentElement(a)_acc1*

**For metal projection reel:**
>*accessionYear(2012).collectionNumber(79).seriesNumber(1).workNumber(16).instantiationNumber(1)componentElement(a)_acc2*  

**For DPX package:**
>*accessionYear(2012)_collectionNumber(79)_seriesNumber(1)_workNumber(16)_instantiationNumber(1)componentElement(a)_DPX.mkv*  

**For digital audio file accompanying DPX package:**
>*accessionYear(2012)_collectionNumber(79)_seriesNumber(1)_workNumber(16)_instantiationNumber(1)componentElement(a)_AUD.wav*  

**For digital access file(s) derived from DPX package:**
